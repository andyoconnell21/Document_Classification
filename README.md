# Document_Classification
We will read a collection of documents with two possible true labels and training a classifier to determine which label a query document is more likely to have. These essays were created by students who took Computer Science 540 at UW-Madison in 2020 and 2016 and based off training data, we will predict whether an essay was written in 2020 or 2016
